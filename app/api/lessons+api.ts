The strength of a chemical bond is quantified by its **bond energy**, the energy required to break that bond (measured in kJ¬∑mol‚Åª¬π).\n\n**Enthalpy (H)** represents the total energy of a system at constant pressure.  The difference in enthalpy between reactants and products is the **heat of reaction (ŒîH)**:\n\n![equation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mchiwundura/fundalect/main/assets/equations/eq_0.svg)\n\nA reaction is **exothermic** if it releases energy (ŒîH < 0), meaning the energy of the products is lower than the energy of the reactants.  Examples include combustion and respiration.  Conversely, an **endothermic** reaction absorbs energy (ŒîH > 0), resulting in products with higher energy than reactants. Photosynthesis and the thermal decomposition of limestone are examples.\n\nChemical reactions require a minimum energy input to proceed, known as the **activation energy**.  The **activated complex** or **transition state** is a high-energy, short-lived intermediate formed during the reaction, representing the point of maximum energy in the reaction pathway.\n"

The Br√∏nsted-Lowry definition is more general, defining acids as proton ($H^+$) donors and bases as proton acceptors.\n\nAn amphoteric substance can act as both an acid and a base, while an amphiprotic substance can both donate and accept protons.  A conjugate acid-base pair differs by a single proton.  The reaction between an acid and a base is a neutralization reaction.  Acids and bases have many applications in domestic, biological, and industrial settings. Indicators change color depending on the acidity or basicity of a solution.\n\nReactions between acids and metal hydroxides, metal oxides, and metal carbonates produce salts and water (and carbon dioxide in the carbonate case).\n\n\n### Redox Reactions\n\nOxidation is the loss of electrons, and reduction is the gain of electrons.  A redox reaction involves both oxidation and reduction, with a transfer of electrons between species.  The oxidation number represents the charge an atom would have if the compound were ionic.  An increase in oxidation number indicates oxidation, while a decrease indicates reduction.  A reducing agent is oxidized, while an oxidizing agent is reduced.  Redox reactions can be analyzed using half-reactions, which represent the oxidation or reduction processes separately.  In a balanced redox reaction, the number of electrons lost in the oxidation half-reaction equals the number of electrons gained in the reduction half-reaction.\n"

Atoms bond to achieve a more stable electron configuration, usually by filling their outer valence electron shell.  Several forces are involved: attraction between positive nuclei and negative electrons, and repulsion between like charges (electrons and nuclei).  The balance of these forces determines the stability and energy of the bond.\n\n### Representing Molecular Structure\n\nLewis diagrams use dots or crosses to represent valence electrons, helping visualize bonding.\n\n### Types of Covalent Bonds\n\nCovalent bonds involve the sharing of electron pairs between atoms.  These can be single (one shared pair), double (two shared pairs), or triple (three shared pairs) bonds.  A dative covalent bond is a special type of covalent bond where both shared electrons originate from the same atom. Examples include the hydronium ion ($H_3O^+$) and the ammonium ion ($NH_4^+$).\n\n\n### Molecular Geometry\n\nThe Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory predicts molecular shapes by minimizing repulsion between electron pairs around the central atom.\n\n### Electronegativity and Bond Polarity\n\nElectronegativity measures an atom's ability to attract electrons in a bond.  The difference in electronegativity between atoms determines bond polarity:\n\n*   **Non-polar covalent bonds:** Occur between identical atoms or atoms with similar electronegativities.\n*   **Polar covalent bonds:** Occur between atoms with different electronegativities, resulting in a slightly positive and slightly negative end of the bond.\n\nA molecule's overall polarity depends on the polarity of its bonds and its molecular geometry.  Symmetrical molecules with polar bonds can be non-polar if the bond dipoles cancel each other out.\n\n### Bond Properties\n\n*   **Bond length:** The distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms.\n*   **Bond energy:** The energy required to break a bond.\n*   **Bond strength:**  How strongly atoms are held together. This is influenced by bond length, atom size, and the number of bonds between atoms.\n"

The type of intermolecular force present depends on the nature of the molecules involved.\n\n* **Polar molecules:** Have an unequal distribution of charge, resulting in a dipole (slightly positive and slightly negative regions).\n* **Non-polar molecules:** Have an equal distribution of charge.\n\nThere are five main types of intermolecular forces:\n\n1. **Ion-dipole forces:** Exist between ions and polar molecules. The ion is attracted to the oppositely charged part of the dipole.\n2. **Ion-induced dipole forces:** Exist between ions and non-polar molecules. The ion induces a temporary dipole in the non-polar molecule.\n3. **Dipole-dipole forces:** Exist between two polar molecules.\n4. **Dipole-induced dipole forces:** Exist between a polar and a non-polar molecule. The polar molecule induces a temporary dipole in the non-polar molecule.\n5. **Induced dipole forces:** Exist between two non-polar molecules due to temporary, fluctuating dipoles.\n\n\nDipole-dipole forces, dipole-induced dipole forces, and induced dipole forces are collectively known as **van der Waals forces**.\n\n**Hydrogen bonds** are a special type of strong dipole-dipole force that occurs when a hydrogen atom is bonded to a highly electronegative atom (oxygen, fluorine, or nitrogen).  The hydrogen atom is attracted to the electronegative atom on a neighboring molecule.\n\n\n### Properties of Substances and Intermolecular Forces\n\nIntermolecular forces significantly influence the properties of substances:\n\n* **Stronger intermolecular forces** generally lead to:\n    * Higher melting and boiling points\n    * Higher viscosity (resistance to flow)\n    * Higher density\n    * Lower thermal expansion (less expansion upon heating)\n    * Lower thermal conductivity (less efficient heat transfer)\n\n* **Weaker intermolecular forces** generally lead to the opposite of the above.\n\n**Water**, with its strong hydrogen bonds, exhibits unique properties:\n\n* High specific heat capacity\n* Absorption of infrared radiation\n* Large liquid range\n* High heat of vaporization\n* Less dense solid phase (ice floats on water)\n\n\n**Specific heat:** The amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of one unit mass of a substance by one degree.\n\n**Heat of vaporization:** The energy required to change a given quantity of a substance from liquid to gas.\n"

It explores the speed of light, refraction, refractive index, and techniques for sketching ray diagrams.

The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, and all rays lie in the same plane.\n\n### The Speed of Light\n\nLight travels at its maximum speed in a vacuum.  Its speed is slightly slower in other media. This difference in speed causes refraction.\n\n### Refraction and Refractive Index\n\nRefraction is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another.  Each medium has a refractive index (n), indicating how much light bends upon entering that medium.  The refractive index is related to the optical density of the medium.\n\n### Sketching Ray Diagrams\n\nRay diagrams show the path of light through different media, illustrating the effects of refractive indices on light bending.\n\n### Snell's Law\n\nSnell's Law allows for the precise calculation of light bending:  ![equation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mchiwundura/fundalect/main/assets/equations/eq_0.svg).  This equation relates refractive indices ($n_1$, $n_2$) to angles of incidence ($\\theta_1$) and refraction ($\\theta_2$).\n\n### Total Internal Reflection\n\nWhen light travels from a denser to a less dense medium, at an angle exceeding the critical angle, total internal reflection occurs.  All light is reflected back into the denser medium. This phenomenon has applications in various fields.\n"

In geometrical optics, they are represented as straight arrows.  Light rays reflect off surfaces. The incident ray strikes the surface, and the reflected ray bounces off. The normal is the line perpendicular to the surface at the point of incidence.  The angle of incidence ($\\\\theta_i$) is the angle between the incident ray and the normal. The angle of reflection ($\\\\theta_r$) is the angle between the reflected ray and the normal.\n\n\n### Refraction\n\nLight can be absorbed and transmitted. The speed of light (c) is constant in a given medium, with a maximum speed in a vacuum of approximately $3 \\times 10^8 \\, m/s$. Refraction occurs when light passes from one medium to another, causing a change in speed but not frequency.  If the light ray hits the boundary at an angle (not perpendicular or parallel), it changes direction, appearing to \"bend\".\n\nOptical density measures a medium's refracting power.  The angle of refraction is the angle between the normal and the refracted ray.\n\n### Snell's Law and Refraction\n\nSnell's Law describes the relationship between refractive indices and angles:\n\n![equation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mchiwundura/fundalect/main/assets/equations/eq_0.svg)\n\nLight traveling from a denser to a less dense medium refracts away from the normal; from a less dense to a denser medium, it refracts towards the normal.\n\n### Total Internal Reflection\n\nThe critical angle is the angle of incidence where the angle of refraction is 90¬∞. Total internal reflection occurs when light travels from a denser to a less dense medium and the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle. This phenomenon is used in optical fibers and endoscopes.\n"

Key tenets include: gases are composed of constantly moving particles with negligible volume compared to the space they occupy; particles have negligible intermolecular forces except during collisions; and the average kinetic energy of the particles is directly proportional to temperature.\n\n### Pressure and Temperature\n\nThe pressure of a gas is a measure of the force exerted by gas particles per unit area, resulting from their collisions with the container walls and each other.  Temperature, on the other hand, is a measure of the average kinetic energy of these particles.\n\n### Ideal vs. Real Gases\n\nAn ideal gas is a theoretical model where particles have negligible volume and no intermolecular forces.  In contrast, real gases exhibit deviations from ideal behavior, particularly at high pressures (where particle volume becomes significant) and low temperatures (where intermolecular forces become important).\n\n### Gas Laws\n\nSeveral laws describe the relationships between the properties of gases:\n\n* **Boyle's Law:**  At constant temperature, the pressure of a fixed amount of gas is inversely proportional to its volume ($p_1V_1 = p_2V_2$).\n\n* **Charles' Law:** At constant pressure, the volume of a fixed amount of gas is directly proportional to its Kelvin temperature ($V_1/T_1 = V_2/T_2$).\n\n* **Pressure-Temperature Relationship:** At constant volume, the pressure of a fixed amount of gas is directly proportional to its Kelvin temperature ($p_1/T_1 = p_2/T_2$).  Note that temperature must be in Kelvin ($T_K = T_C + 273$).\n\n* **General Gas Equation:** Combines Boyle's Law and the pressure-temperature relationship: $p_1V_1/T_1 = p_2V_2/T_2$. This applies when the amount of gas remains constant.\n\n* **Avogadro's Law:** Equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain the same number of molecules.\n\n### The Ideal Gas Equation\n\nThe ideal gas equation integrates these relationships:\n\n![equation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mchiwundura/fundalect/main/assets/equations/eq_0.svg)\n\nwhere:\n\n* p = pressure (Pa)\n* V = volume (m¬≥)\n* n = number of moles (mol)\n* R = universal gas constant (8.314 J¬∑K‚Åª¬π¬∑mol‚Åª¬π)\n* T = temperature (K)\n\nThis equation uses SI units for all parameters.\n\n\n### Table of Units\n\n| Quantity | Unit Name   | Unit Symbol |\n| --------- | ----------- | ----------- |\n| Moles (n) | moles       | mol         |\n| Pressure (p) | pascals     | Pa          |\n| Temperature (T) | kelvin      | K           |\n| Volume (V)  | cubic meters | m¬≥          |\n\n"

This allows us to calculate the volume of any number of moles of gas at STP using the formula:\n\n![equation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mchiwundura/fundalect/main/assets/equations/eq_0.svg)\n\nwhere:\n\n* $V_g$ is the volume of the gas (in dm¬≥)\n* $n_g$ is the number of moles of the gas\n\n\n### Gas Volume Relationships in Reactions\n\nThe volumes of reacting gases are directly proportional to their stoichiometric coefficients in a balanced chemical equation.  For two gases A and B, the relationship is:\n\n![equation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mchiwundura/fundalect/main/assets/equations/eq_0.svg)\n\nwhere:\n\n* $V_A$ is the volume of gas A\n* $V_B$ is the volume of gas B\n* $a$ and $b$ are the stoichiometric coefficients of A and B, respectively.\n\n### Concentration Calculations\n\nThe concentration (c) of a solution is defined as the number of moles (n) of solute per unit volume (V) of solution:\n\n![equation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mchiwundura/fundalect/main/assets/equations/eq_0.svg)\n\nwhere:\n\n* c is the concentration (mol¬∑dm‚Åª¬≥)\n* n is the number of moles of solute\n* V is the volume of the solution (dm¬≥)\n\nA standard solution has a precisely known concentration.\n\n### Titration Calculations\n\nTitration is a technique to determine the concentration of an unknown solution.  The calculation uses the following relationship:\n\n![equation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mchiwundura/fundalect/main/assets/equations/eq_0.svg)\n\nwhere:\n\n* $c_A$ and $c_B$ are the concentrations of solutions A and B\n* $V_A$ and $V_B$ are the volumes of solutions A and B\n* $a$ and $b$ are the stoichiometric coefficients of A and B in the balanced equation\n\n\n### Limiting and Excess Reagents\n\nThe limiting reagent is completely consumed in a reaction, determining the maximum amount of product formed.  The excess reagent is the reactant left over after the reaction is complete.\n\n### Percent Yield\n\nPercent yield represents the efficiency of a reaction:\n\n![equation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mchiwundura/fundalect/main/assets/equations/eq_0.svg)\n\n### Empirical and Molecular Formulas\n\nThe empirical formula shows the simplest whole-number ratio of atoms in a compound. The molecular formula represents the actual number of atoms of each element in a molecule.\n\n### Percent Purity\n\nPercent purity indicates the proportion of a desired compound in a sample:\n\n![equation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mchiwundura/fundalect/main/assets/equations/eq_0.svg)\n\n\n### Units Used in Calculations\n\n| Quantity       | Unit Name             | Unit Symbol |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------|\n| Concentration (c) | moles per cubic decimetre | mol¬∑dm‚Åª¬≥     |\n| Mass (m)        | kilogram              | kg           |\n| Moles (n)       | moles                 | mol          |\n| Volume (V)      | cubic decimetres       | dm¬≥          |\n\n\n"

It has at most two solutions. For example,  `x¬≤ + 2x - 3 = 0` is a quadratic equation.\n\n### Simultaneous Equations\n\nSolving for two unknown variables requires a system of two simultaneous equations. These can be solved using algebraic methods (substitution or elimination) or graphically by finding the point of intersection of the graphs of each equation.\n\n### Literal Equations\n\nLiteral equations contain multiple letters and variables.  They are solved by manipulating the equation to isolate the desired variable.\n\n### Word Problems\n\nWord problems are solved by translating the real-world scenario into a set of mathematical equations.  This involves identifying the unknowns, setting up appropriate equations based on the given information, and solving the resulting equations.\n\n### Linear Inequalities\n\nA linear inequality is similar to a linear equation, but instead of an equals sign (=), it uses inequality symbols (<, >, ‚â§, ‚â•).  Remember that when multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the direction of the inequality sign reverses.\n"

Opposite angles are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other.\n\n* **Rectangle:** A parallelogram with all four angles equal to 90¬∞.\n\n* **Rhombus:** A parallelogram with all four sides equal in length. The diagonals bisect each other at 90¬∞ and also bisect the opposite angles.\n\n* **Square:** A rhombus with all four angles equal to 90¬∞.\n\n* **Trapezium:** A quadrilateral with only one pair of parallel opposite sides.\n\n* **Kite:** A quadrilateral with two pairs of adjacent sides equal. One pair of opposite angles are equal (the angles between the unequal sides). The diagonal connecting the equal sides bisects the other diagonal and bisects the angles it connects. The diagonals intersect at 90¬∞.\n\n\n### Mid-point Theorem\n\nThe mid-point theorem states that the line segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.\n"
