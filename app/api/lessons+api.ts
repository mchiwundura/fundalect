Measured in kJ¬∑mol‚Åª¬π.\n* **Enthalpy (H):** The total energy content of a system at constant pressure.\n\n### Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions\n\n* **Exothermic Reactions:** Release energy to the surroundings. ŒîH is negative (ŒîH < 0). Examples include combustion and respiration.\n* **Endothermic Reactions:** Absorb energy from the surroundings. ŒîH is positive (ŒîH > 0). Examples include photosynthesis and the thermal decomposition of limestone.\n\nThe difference in energy between reactants and products is the **heat of reaction (ŒîH)**.  It's calculated as:\n\n```math\n      E_prod\nŒîH = ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\n      E_react\n```\n\nWhere E<sub>prod</sub> is the total energy of the products and E<sub>react</sub> is the total energy of the reactants.\n\n### Activation Energy\n\nAll reactions require a minimum amount of energy to start, called the **activation energy**.  This energy is needed to overcome the energy barrier and form the **activated complex**, a temporary, high-energy intermediate state during the reaction.\n"

Noble gases, with their full valence shells, serve as a reference point; other atoms bond to achieve a similar stable electron configuration.\n\nThree main forces are at play: attraction between the positive nucleus of one atom and the negative electrons of another, and repulsion between like-charged electrons and like-charged nuclei.  The balance between these attractive and repulsive forces determines the overall energy of the system; the minimum energy state corresponds to a stable bond.\n\nLewis diagrams are a useful tool for visualizing molecular structure.  These diagrams represent valence electrons as dots or crosses surrounding the central atom.\n\nCovalent bonds involve the sharing of electron pairs between atoms.  Single, double, and triple bonds represent the sharing of one, two, and three electron pairs, respectively.\n\nA dative covalent bond (or coordinate bond) is a special type of covalent bond where both shared electrons originate from the same atom.  Examples include the hydronium ion (H‚ÇÉO‚Å∫) and the ammonium ion (NH‚ÇÑ‚Å∫).\n\nThe shapes of molecules can be predicted using the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory.  This theory minimizes electron-pair repulsion around the central atom to determine the most stable molecular geometry.\n\nElectronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons towards itself in a chemical bond.  This property explains the difference between polar and non-polar covalent bonds. Polar covalent bonds form between atoms with differing electronegativities, resulting in an uneven distribution of charge. Non-polar covalent bonds occur between identical atoms or atoms with very similar electronegativities.\n\nPolar molecules possess a slightly positive end and a slightly negative end due to uneven charge distribution.  Examples include water (H‚ÇÇO), ammonia (NH‚ÇÉ), and hydrogen chloride (HCl). Non-polar molecules have an even charge distribution, often due to molecular symmetry.\n\nBond length is the distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms. Bond energy is the amount of energy required to break a bond. Bond strength depends on bond length, atom size, and the number of bonds between the atoms.\n"

We will explore the concept of a light ray, the speed of light in different media, and how to sketch ray diagrams.  We will also cover Snell's law and the phenomenon of total internal reflection.\n\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n*   **Reflection and the Law of Reflection:** A light ray is an imaginary line representing the path of light. The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, measured from the normal to the surface.\n\n*   **The Speed of Light:** Light travels fastest in a vacuum. Its speed is reduced when passing through other media. This change in speed causes refraction.\n\n*   **Refraction and Refractive Index:** Refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another. The refractive index of a medium quantifies how much light bends when entering that medium.  A higher refractive index indicates a greater degree of bending.\n\n*   **Sketching Ray Diagrams:** Ray diagrams illustrate the path of light through different media, showing how light bends depending on the refractive indices of the media involved.\n\n*   **Snell's Law:** Snell's Law precisely describes the relationship between the angles of incidence and refraction, and the refractive indices of the two media:\n\n```math\n      n‚ÇÅ sinŒ∏‚ÇÅ\n  =  ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\n      n‚ÇÇ sinŒ∏‚ÇÇ \n```\n\n*   **Total Internal Reflection:** When light travels from a denser to a less dense medium and the angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle, total internal reflection occurs. All light is reflected back into the denser medium.  This phenomenon has applications in various fields, including communications and medicine.\n"

Light rays reflect off surfaces. The incident ray strikes the surface, and the reflected ray bounces off. The normal is a line perpendicular to the surface at the point of incidence. The angle of incidence (Œ∏·µ¢) is the angle between the incident ray and the normal; the angle of reflection (Œ∏·µ£) is the angle between the reflected ray and the normal.\n\nThe **Law of Reflection** states: Œ∏·µ¢ = Œ∏·µ£, and the incident ray, reflected ray, and normal lie in the same plane.\n\nLight can also be absorbed and transmitted. The speed of light (c) is constant in a given medium, with a maximum speed in a vacuum of 3 √ó 10‚Å∏ m¬∑s‚Åª¬π.\n\n\n### Refraction\n\nRefraction occurs when light passes from one medium to another, changing speed but maintaining its frequency.  If the light hits the boundary at an angle (other than perpendicular or parallel), it changes direction (bends).\n\nThe **refractive index** (n) of a material indicates how difficult it is for light to pass through:\n\n```math\n      c\n n =  ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\n      v\n```\n\nwhere *c* is the speed of light in a vacuum and *v* is the speed of light in the material.  Optical density measures a medium's refracting power. The normal is perpendicular to the surface. The angle of incidence is between the normal and the incident ray; the angle of refraction is between the normal and the refracted ray.\n\n**Snell's Law** describes refraction:\n\n```math\n n‚ÇÅ sin Œ∏‚ÇÅ = n‚ÇÇ sin Œ∏‚ÇÇ\n```\n\nLight bends towards the normal when moving into a denser medium and away from the normal when moving into a less dense medium.\n\n\n### Critical Angle and Total Internal Reflection\n\nThe **critical angle** is the angle of incidence where the angle of refraction is 90¬∞.  **Total internal reflection** happens when light travels from a denser to a less dense medium and the angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle. All light is reflected back into the denser medium; no refraction occurs.  This is used in optical fibers and endoscopes.\n"

The amount of bending or spreading depends on the size of the aperture or obstacle relative to the wavelength of the wave.\n\n### Diffraction and Wavelength/Slit Width\n\nThe degree of diffraction is directly proportional to the wavelength (Œª) of the wave and inversely proportional to the width (w) of the slit or aperture.

Real gases deviate from this ideal behavior, particularly at high pressures (particle volume becomes significant) and low temperatures (intermolecular forces become important).\n\n### Gas Laws\n\nSeveral laws describe the relationships between pressure (p), volume (V), temperature (T), and amount (n) of a gas:\n\n* **Boyle's Law:**  At constant temperature,  `p‚ÇÅV‚ÇÅ = p‚ÇÇV‚ÇÇ` (pressure and volume are inversely proportional).\n\n* **Charles' Law:** At constant pressure, `V‚ÇÅ/T‚ÇÅ = V‚ÇÇ/T‚ÇÇ` (volume and Kelvin temperature are directly proportional).\n\n* **Pressure-Temperature Relationship:** At constant volume, `p‚ÇÅ/T‚ÇÅ = p‚ÇÇ/T‚ÇÇ` (pressure and Kelvin temperature are directly proportional).\n\nTo use Charles' Law and the pressure-temperature relationship, temperature must be in Kelvin (K):  T<sub>K</sub> = T<sub>C</sub> + 273.\n\n* **General Gas Equation:** Combining Boyle's Law and the pressure-temperature relationship, `p‚ÇÅV‚ÇÅ/T‚ÇÅ = p‚ÇÇV‚ÇÇ/T‚ÇÇ`.\n\n* **Avogadro's Law:** Equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain the same number of molecules.\n\n* **Ideal Gas Equation:**  Extending these concepts to include the amount of gas (n), the ideal gas equation is `pV = nRT`, where R is the universal gas constant (R = 8.314 J¬∑K‚Åª¬π¬∑mol‚Åª¬π).  SI units (m¬≥ for volume, Pa for pressure, K for temperature) must be used.\n\n\n### Units in the Ideal Gas Equation\n\n| Quantity | Unit Name  | Unit Symbol |\n|---|---|---|\n| Moles (n) | moles      | mol         |\n| Pressure (p) | pascals    | Pa          |\n| Temperature (T) | kelvin     | K           |\n| Volume (V) | meters cubed | m¬≥          |\n\n\n"

A diploid cell (2n) undergoes two successive divisions: Meiosis I and Meiosis II.\n\n**Key Stages:**\n\n**Meiosis I:**\n\n- *Prophase I*: Chromosomes become visible; homologous chromosomes pair and crossing over occurs at chiasmata.\n- *Metaphase I*: Homologous pairs line up at the equator.\n- *Anaphase I*: Homologous chromosomes are pulled to opposite poles.\n- *Telophase I*: Two haploid cells form, each with half the number of chromosomes.\n\n**Meiosis II:**\n\n- *Prophase II*: New spindles form in each haploid cell.\n- *Metaphase II*: Chromosomes line up individually at the equator.\n- *Anaphase II*: Sister chromatids are pulled apart.\n- *Telophase II*: Four genetically distinct haploid cells result.\n\n**Importance of Meiosis:**\n\n1. **Genetic variation** through crossing over and independent assortment.\n2. **Maintains chromosome number** across generations.\n\n**Abnormal Meiosis:**\n\nWhen chromosomes fail to separate (non-disjunction), gametes may have an abnormal number of chromosomes. If such a gamete is involved in fertilization, it may result in conditions like **Down syndrome**, where there is an extra copy of chromosome 21.\n\n---\n\n\n"

This is crucial for proper cell function and enzyme activity.\n\n### Key Examples of Homeostasis\n\n#### 1. **Temperature Regulation**\n- Normal body temperature: ~37¬∞C\n- Controlled by the **hypothalamus**\n- If too hot:\n  - Sweat glands release sweat (evaporation cools the body)\n  - Vasodilation: blood vessels widen to increase heat loss\n- If too cold:\n  - Shivering generates heat\n  - Vasoconstriction: blood vessels narrow to retain heat\n\n#### 2. **Blood Glucose Regulation**\n- Controlled by the **pancreas**\n- **Insulin** lowers high blood glucose by promoting glucose uptake by cells and storage as glycogen in the liver\n- **Glucagon** raises low blood glucose by converting glycogen back to glucose\n\n#### 3. **Water Balance**\n- Regulated by the **kidneys** and **ADH (antidiuretic hormone)**\n- ADH controls how much water is reabsorbed by the kidneys\n\n### Negative Feedback Mechanism\n\nA **negative feedback loop** is when a change triggers a response that reverses the change to maintain balance.\n\n> Example: If body temperature rises, mechanisms reduce it. Once it's normal, the response stops.\n\n---\n\n"

These responses are controlled by **plant hormones**, especially **auxins**.\n\n### Plant Hormones\n\n- **Auxins:** Stimulate elongation of cells, primarily found in shoot tips.\n- Distributed unevenly in response to light and gravity.\n- Other hormones include gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.\n\n### Types of Tropisms\n\n- **Phototropism:** Growth towards light (positive phototropism in shoots).\n- **Geotropism (Gravitropism):** \n  - Positive in roots (growing downward).\n  - Negative in shoots (growing upward).\n- **Thigmotropism:** Response to touch (e.g., tendrils coiling around objects).\n\n### How Auxins Work\n\n- In shoots, auxins accumulate on the shaded side ‚Üí cells elongate ‚Üí shoot bends toward light.\n- In roots, auxins inhibit cell elongation on the lower side ‚Üí root grows downward.\n\n### Apical Dominance\n\n- The apical bud suppresses the growth of lateral buds.\n- Cutting the apical bud allows lateral branches to grow.\n\n---\n"

It is measured in square units.  Formulas for common shapes include:\n\n* **Square:** Area = s¬≤ (where s is the side length)\n* **Rectangle:** Area = b √ó h (where b is the base and h is the height)\n* **Triangle:** Area = (1/2) √ó b √ó h (where b is the base and h is the height)\n* **Trapezium:** Area = (1/2)(a + b) √ó h (where a and b are the parallel sides and h is the height)\n* **Parallelogram:** Area = b √ó h (where b is the base and h is the height)\n* **Circle:** Area = œÄr¬≤ (where r is the radius)\n\n\n### Prisms and Cylinders\n\nA right prism has a polygon base, vertical sides perpendicular to the base, and identical top and bottom surfaces.  A cylinder is a right prism with a circular base.\n\n* **Surface Area:** The total area of the exposed surfaces.  (Specific formulas depend on the shape of the prism).\n* **Volume:** The three-dimensional space occupied. Formulas include:\n    * **Rectangular Prism:** Volume = l √ó b √ó h (where l is length, b is width, and h is height)\n    * **Triangular Prism:** Volume = (1/2 √ó b √ó h) √ó H (where b and h are the base and height of the triangle, and H is the prism's height)\n    * **Cube (Square Prism):** Volume = s¬≥ (where s is the side length)\n    * **Cylinder:** Volume = œÄr¬≤ √ó h (where r is the radius and h is the height)\n\n\n### Pyramids, Cones, and Spheres\n\n* **Pyramid:** A geometric solid with a polygon base and sides converging at a point (the apex).  A right pyramid has an apex directly above the center of the base.\n* **Cone:** Similar to a pyramid, but with a circular base.  A right cone has its apex directly above the center of the base.\n* **Sphere:** A perfectly round solid.\n\nSurface area and volume formulas for these shapes are:\n\n**Surface Area:**\n\n* **Square Pyramid:**  Area = b(b + 2h) (where b is base side and h is slant height)\n* **Triangular Pyramid:** Area = (1/2)b(hb + 3hs) (where b is base length, hb is base height, hs is slant height)\n* **Right Cone:** Area = œÄr(r + hs) (where r is the radius and hs is the slant height)\n* **Sphere:** Area = 4œÄr¬≤ (where r is the radius)\n\n**Volume:**\n\n* **Square Pyramid:** Volume = (1/3) √ó b¬≤ √ó H (where b is the base side and H is the height)\n* **Triangular Pyramid:** Volume = (1/3) √ó (1/2 √ó b √ó h) √ó H (where b and h are the base and height of the triangle, and H is the pyramid's height)\n* **Right Cone:** Volume = (1/3) √ó œÄr¬≤ √ó H (where r is the radius and H is the height)\n* **Sphere:** Volume = (4/3)œÄr¬≥ (where r is the radius)\n\n\n### Scaling\n\nMultiplying one or more dimensions of a prism or cylinder by a constant *k* will affect the surface area and volume.  The exact effect depends on which dimensions are scaled.\n"

The box represents the interquartile range (IQR), which is the difference between Q3 and Q1 (IQR = Q3 - Q1).  A line inside the box indicates the median.  Whiskers extend from the box to the minimum and maximum values.\n\n\n**Worked Example:**\n\nLet's find the five number summary for the dataset: {1.25, 1.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.25, 4.75, 4.8, 4.95, 5.1}\n\n1. **Sort the data:** The data is already sorted.\n2. **Minimum:** 1.25\n3. **Maximum:** 5.1\n4. **Median (Q2):**  There are 12 values, so the median is the average of the 6th and 7th values: (3.2 + 4.1) / 2 = 3.65\n5. **First Quartile (Q1):** The median of the lower half (1.25, 1.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3.1, 3.2): (2.5 + 2.5) / 2 = 2.5\n6. **Third Quartile (Q3):** The median of the upper half (4.1, 4.25, 4.75, 4.8, 4.95, 5.1): (4.75 + 4.8) / 2 = 4.775\n\nTherefore, the five number summary is: Minimum = 1.25, Q1 = 2.5, Median = 3.65, Q3 = 4.775, Maximum = 5.1\n\n\n**Additional Examples:**\n\nSeveral additional examples of calculating five-number summaries and constructing box-and-whisker plots from different datasets are omitted for brevity.  The process remains consistent: sort the data, find the minimum, maximum, median, Q1, and Q3.  Then, represent these values graphically in a box-and-whisker plot.\n"

The formula for simple interest is:\n\n```math\nA = P(1 + in)\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n* A = Future Value\n* P = Principal (initial amount)\n* i = Interest rate per period\n* n = Number of periods\n\n\n#### Compound Interest\n\nCompound interest is calculated on both the principal amount and accumulated interest from previous periods. The formula for compound interest is:\n\n```math\nA = P(1 + i)^n\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n* A = Future Value\n* P = Principal (initial amount)\n* i = Interest rate per period\n* n = Number of periods\n\n\n#### Simple Depreciation\n\nSimple depreciation is a method where the depreciation amount is constant each period. The formula for simple depreciation is:\n\n```math\nA = P(1 - in)\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n* A = Future Value\n* P = Initial Value\n* i = Depreciation rate per period\n* n = Number of periods\n\n\n#### Compound Depreciation\n\nCompound depreciation is a method where the depreciation amount is calculated on the remaining value each period. The formula for compound depreciation is:\n\n```math\nA = P(1 - i)^n\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n* A = Future Value\n* P = Initial Value\n* i = Depreciation rate per period\n* n = Number of periods\n\n\n#### Nominal and Effective Annual Interest Rates\n\nThe relationship between nominal and effective annual interest rates is given by:\n\n```math\n1 + i = (1 + i^(m)/m)^m\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n* i = Effective annual interest rate\n* i^(m) = Nominal interest rate compounded m times per year\n\nThis formula allows for the conversion between nominal rates (stated interest rate) and effective annual rates (the actual interest earned considering compounding).\n"
