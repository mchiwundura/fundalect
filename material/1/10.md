## Electromagnetism Fundamentals

### Introduction

Electromagnetism is the study of the interaction between electricity and magnetism.  A current-carrying conductor generates a magnetic field around it. The direction of this field can be determined using the Right Hand Rule.

### Electromagnets

Electromagnets are temporary magnets produced by passing an electric current through a coil of wire.  Their magnetic field strength is dependent on the current and the number of turns in the coil.

### Magnetic Flux

Magnetic flux ($Ï•$) is a measure of the total magnetic field that passes through a given area.  It is calculated using the formula:

$Ï• = BAcos(Î¸)$

Where:

* $B$ is the magnetic field strength (Tesla, T)
* $A$ is the area (mÂ²)
* $Î¸$ is the angle between the magnetic field and the surface normal.


### Electromagnetic Induction

Electromagnetic induction describes the process where a changing magnetic field induces a voltage (electromotive force, emf) in a conductor.  This is quantified by Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction:


$â„° = -N \frac{Î”Ï•}{Î”t}$

Where:

* $â„°$ is the induced emf (Volts, V)
* $N$ is the number of turns in the coil
* $\frac{Î”Ï•}{Î”t}$ is the rate of change of magnetic flux (Weber/second, Wb/s)
