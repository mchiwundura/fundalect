## Quantitative Aspects of Chemical Change

This section covers calculations related to chemical reactions, including gas volumes, solution concentrations, and reaction yields.

### Gas Volumes at STP

The molar volume of any gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP) is 22.4 dm¬≥.  This means one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 dm¬≥ at STP.  To calculate the volume of 'n' moles of a gas at STP, use the formula:

$V_g = 22.4n_g$

where $V_g$ is the volume in dm¬≥ and $n_g$ is the number of moles.


### Volume Relationships in Gas Reactions

The volumes of reacting gases are directly proportional to their stoichiometric coefficients.  For a reaction between gases A and B:

$V_A = \frac{a}{b}V_B$

where $V_A$ and $V_B$ are the volumes of gases A and B, and *a* and *b* are their respective stoichiometric coefficients.


### Solution Concentration

The concentration (c) of a solution is calculated using:

$c = \frac{n}{V}$

where c is the concentration in mol¬∑dm‚Åª¬≥, n is the number of moles of solute, and V is the volume of the solution in dm¬≥.


### Titrations

Titration is a technique to determine the concentration of an unknown solution.  The following equation can be used:

$\frac{c_AV_A}{a} = \frac{c_BV_B}{b}$

where $c_A$ and $c_B$ are the concentrations, $V_A$ and $V_B$ are the volumes, and *a* and *b* are the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants.


### Limiting and Excess Reagents

The limiting reagent is completely consumed in a reaction, determining the maximum amount of product formed. The excess reagent is the reactant left over after the reaction is complete.


### Percent Yield

Percent yield represents the efficiency of a reaction:

% yield = $\frac{\text{actual yield}}{\text{theoretical yield}} \times 100$


### Empirical and Molecular Formulas

The empirical formula represents the simplest whole-number ratio of atoms in a compound. The molecular formula shows the actual number of atoms of each element in a molecule.


### Percent Purity

Percent purity indicates the proportion of a desired compound in a sample:

% purity = $\frac{\text{mass of compound}}{\text{mass of sample}} \times 100$


### Units Used in Calculations

| Quantity       | Unit Name                | Unit Symbol |
|-----------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| Concentration (c) | moles per cubic decimetre | mol¬∑dm‚Åª¬≥     |
| Mass (m)        | kilogram                 | kg           |
| Moles (n)       | moles                     | mol          |
| Volume (V)      | cubic decimetres          | dm¬≥          |
