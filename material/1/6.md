## Wavefronts, Huygens' Principle, and Diffraction

### Wavefronts

A wavefront is an imaginary line connecting points on a wave that are in phase.  This means the points on the wavefront are all at the same stage of their oscillation (e.g., all at their maximum displacement).

### Huygens' Principle

Huygens' Principle states that every point on a wavefront can be considered as a source of secondary spherical wavelets.  After a time interval, the new position of the wavefront is the surface that is tangent to all of these secondary wavelets. This principle helps explain wave propagation and phenomena like diffraction.

### Diffraction

Diffraction is the ability of a wave to spread out as it passes through an aperture (opening) or around a sharp edge.  When a wave passes through a slit, for example, the wavefront bends or spreads out. This spreading is more significant when the wavelength is large compared to the size of the opening.

### Factors Affecting Diffraction

The degree of diffraction depends on the relationship between the wavelength of the wave ($\\lambda$) and the width ($w$) of the aperture or obstacle.  The diffraction is greater when the wavelength is larger relative to the width of the slit:

$\\text{diffraction} \\propto \\frac{\\lambda}{w}$

A larger wavelength or a smaller slit width leads to more pronounced diffraction.
