## Newton's Laws and Forces

### Forces

* **Normal Force ($\\vec{N}$):** The force exerted by a surface on an object in contact with it, perpendicular to the surface.
* **Frictional Force:**  A force opposing motion between surfaces in contact, parallel to the surface. Its magnitude is proportional to the normal force.
* **Coefficients of Friction:**
    * $\\mu_s$: Coefficient of static friction.
    * $\\mu_k$: Coefficient of kinetic friction.

### Force Components on an Inclined Plane

For an object on an inclined plane with angle Œ∏:

* $F_{gx} = F_g \sin(\theta)$ (parallel to the slope)
* $F_{gy} = F_g \cos(\theta)$ (perpendicular to the slope)

### Newton's Laws of Motion

* **Newton's First Law (Inertia):** An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.
* **Newton's Second Law:**  $\\vec{F}_{net} = m\\vec{a}$ (Net force equals mass times acceleration)
* **Newton's Third Law (Action-Reaction):** For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.

### Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

$F = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{d^2}$ (The force of gravity between two masses is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.)
