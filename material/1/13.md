## Acid-Base and Redox Reactions

### Acid-Base Reactions

There are several ways to define acids and bases.  The Arrhenius definition describes acids as substances that increase the concentration of hydronium ions ($H_3O^+$) in water, and bases as substances that increase the hydroxide ion ($OH^-$) concentration in water.  This definition is limited to aqueous solutions.

The Br√∏nsted-Lowry model offers a broader definition. A Br√∏nsted-Lowry acid is a proton ($H^+$) donor, while a Br√∏nsted-Lowry base is a proton acceptor.

An amphoteric substance can act as both an acid and a base.  Water is a common example. An amphiprotic substance can act as both a proton donor and a proton acceptor; examples include $HCO_3^-$ and $HSO_4^-$.

A conjugate acid-base pair consists of two species that differ by a single proton.  The reaction between an acid and a base is called a neutralization reaction.

Acids and bases have numerous applications in domestic, biological, and industrial settings. Indicators are substances that change color depending on the pH of a solution.

Reactions between acids and various substances produce specific products:

*   Acid + metal hydroxide ‚Üí salt + water
*   Acid + metal oxide ‚Üí salt + water
*   Acid + metal carbonate ‚Üí salt + water + carbon dioxide


### Redox Reactions

Oxidation is the loss of electrons, while reduction is the gain of electrons.  A redox reaction involves both oxidation and reduction, with a transfer of electrons between species.  The oxidation number represents the charge an atom would have if the compound were composed entirely of ions.  An increase in oxidation number indicates oxidation; a decrease indicates reduction.

A half-reaction represents either the oxidation or reduction portion of a redox reaction.  The number of electrons lost in the oxidation half-reaction must equal the number of electrons gained in the reduction half-reaction.

An oxidizing agent is reduced (gains electrons), while a reducing agent is oxidized (loses electrons).
