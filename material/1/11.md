## Ohm's Law and Electrical Circuits

### Ohm's Law

Ohm's Law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points, and inversely proportional to the resistance between them.  The formula is: $I = \frac{V}{R}$, where:

*   $I$ is the current in Amperes (A)
*   $V$ is the voltage in Volts (V)
*   $R$ is the resistance in Ohms (Î©)

Conductors that obey Ohm's Law are called ohmic conductors; those that do not are called non-ohmic conductors.


### Calculating Resistance

The resistance of a resistor can be calculated using Ohm's Law: $R = \frac{V}{I}$.


### Resistors in Series and Parallel

The equivalent resistance of resistors in series ($R_s$) is the sum of the individual resistances:  $R_s = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + ... + R_n$.

The equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel ($R_p$) is calculated as: $\frac{1}{R_p} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + ... + \frac{1}{R_n}$.


### Electrical Power and Energy

Electrical power (P) is the rate at which electrical energy is converted. It can be calculated using these formulas:

*   $P = VI$
*   $P = I^2R$
*   $P = \frac{V^2}{R}$

Power is measured in Watts (W).

Electrical energy (E) dissipated is calculated as: $E = Pt$, where t is time in seconds. Energy is measured in Joules (J).

One kilowatt hour (kWh) represents the use of one kilowatt of power for one hour.
