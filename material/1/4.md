## Geometrical Optics

This chapter introduces geometrical optics, building upon prior knowledge of reflection and the law of reflection.  We will explore the concept of a light ray, the speed of light in different media, and how to sketch ray diagrams.  We will also cover Snell's Law and the phenomenon of total internal reflection.


### Reflection and the Law of Reflection

The concept of a light ray, a useful tool for understanding light's behavior, is introduced.  The law of reflectionâ€”the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflectionâ€”is reviewed.


### The Speed of Light

Light travels at different speeds in different media.  Its maximum speed is achieved in a vacuum. The change in speed is the reason for refraction.


### Refraction and Refractive Index

Refraction is the bending of light as it moves between media.  Each medium has a refractive index, indicating how much light bends upon entering. This is linked to the medium's optical density.


### Sketching Ray Diagrams

This section teaches how to sketch light's path through different media, reinforcing the concept of refractive indices and how light bends depending on the medium's refractive index.


### Snell's Law

Snell's Law allows for the precise calculation of light bending and refractive indices.  It relates the refractive indices of two media and the angles of incidence and refraction:  $n_1 sinÎ¸_1 = n_2 sinÎ¸_2$.


### Total Internal Reflection

Snell's Law leads to the concept of a critical angle, relevant when light travels from a denser to a less dense medium.  Beyond this critical angle, total internal reflection occurs, with all light reflecting back into the denser medium.  This phenomenon has applications in various fields.
