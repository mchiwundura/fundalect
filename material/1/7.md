## Kinetic Theory of Gases and Gas Laws

The kinetic theory of gases explains gas behavior based on the motion of gas particles.  Gases consist of constantly moving particles with attractive forces between them.  Pressure arises from particle collisions with each other and the container walls. Temperature reflects the average kinetic energy of these particles.

An ideal gas is a theoretical model with particles of zero volume and no intermolecular forces.  Particles in an ideal gas move at a uniform speed.  Real gases behave similarly to ideal gases, except at high pressures and low temperatures, where intermolecular forces and particle volume become significant.  At sufficiently low temperatures, real gases will liquefy.


### Gas Laws

Several laws describe the relationships between pressure (p), volume (V), temperature (T), and amount (n) of a gas.

**Boyle's Law:** At constant temperature and amount, pressure and volume are inversely proportional: $pV = k$ or $p_1V_1 = p_2V_2$.

**Charles' Law:** At constant pressure and amount, volume is directly proportional to Kelvin temperature: $\\frac{V}{T} = k$ or $\\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \\frac{V_2}{T_2}$.

**Pressure-Temperature Relationship:** At constant volume and amount, pressure is directly proportional to Kelvin temperature: $\\frac{p}{T} = k$ or $\\frac{p_1}{T_1} = \\frac{p_2}{T_2}$.

To use Charles' Law and the pressure-temperature relationship, temperature must be expressed in Kelvin:  $T_K = T_C + 273$.

The general gas equation combines Boyle's Law and the pressure-temperature relationship for a constant amount of gas: $\\frac{pV}{T} = k$ or $\\frac{p_1V_1}{T_1} = \\frac{p_2V_2}{T_2}$.


**Avogadro's Law:** Equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain the same number of molecules.

The ideal gas equation extends these principles to include the amount of gas (n in moles): $pV = nRT$, where R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J¬∑K‚Åª¬π¬∑mol‚Åª¬π). When using the ideal gas equation, remember to use SI units: volume (m¬≥), pressure (Pa), temperature (K), and amount (mol).
