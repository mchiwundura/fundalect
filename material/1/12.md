## Energy Changes in Chemical Reactions

Chemical reactions involve the breaking and forming of chemical bonds.  These processes always involve energy changes.

### Bond Energy and Enthalpy

*   **Bond energy:** The energy required to break a chemical bond.  Measured in kJ·mol⁻¹.
*   **Enthalpy (H):** The total energy of a chemical system at constant pressure.

### Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions

The difference between the energy of the reactants and the products determines whether a reaction is exothermic or endothermic.

*   **Exothermic Reactions:** Release energy (heat or light).  ΔH < 0.  Examples include combustion and respiration.
*   **Endothermic Reactions:** Absorb energy (heat or light). ΔH > 0. Examples include photosynthesis and the thermal decomposition of limestone.


### Heat of Reaction (ΔH)

The heat of reaction (ΔH) represents the difference in energy between reactants and products:

$ΔH = E_{prod} - E_{react}$

*   ΔH < 0 for exothermic reactions.
*   ΔH > 0 for endothermic reactions.

### Activation Energy

*   **Activation Energy:** The minimum energy needed to initiate a chemical reaction.
*   **Activated Complex:** A high-energy, short-lived intermediate formed during a reaction.  It exists at the point of maximum energy in the reaction pathway.
