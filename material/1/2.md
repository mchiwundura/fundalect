## Chemical Bonding and Molecular Structure

A chemical bond is the physical process that causes atoms to be attracted together and bound in new compounds.  Noble gases, with full valence shells, serve as a reference point; other atoms bond to achieve a similar stable electron configuration.

Three forces act between atoms: attractive forces between the positive nucleus of one atom and the negative electrons of another; repulsive forces between like-charged electrons; and repulsive forces between like-charged nuclei.  The energy of a bonded system is at a minimum when these attractive and repulsive forces are balanced.

### Representing Molecular Structure

Lewis diagrams use dots or crosses to represent valence electrons around a central atom, providing a visual representation of molecular structure.

### Types of Covalent Bonds

Covalent bonds involve the sharing of electron pairs between atoms.  A single bond shares one electron pair, a double bond shares two, and a triple bond shares three.  A dative covalent bond is a special case where both shared electrons originate from the same atom.  Examples include the hydronium ion ($H_3O^+$) and the ammonium ion ($NH_4^+$).

### Molecular Shape and VSEPR Theory

The valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory predicts molecular shapes by minimizing electron-pair repulsion around the central atom.

### Electronegativity and Bond Polarity

Electronegativity describes an atom's ability to attract electrons in a bond.  This determines the polarity of a covalent bond.  Polar covalent bonds form between non-identical atoms with differing electronegativities, while non-polar covalent bonds form between identical atoms or atoms with similar electronegativities.  A polar molecule possesses a slightly positive end and a slightly negative end (e.g., water, ammonia, hydrogen chloride), whereas a non-polar molecule has an even charge distribution or is a symmetrical molecule with polar bonds.

### Bond Properties

Bond length is the distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms. Bond energy is the energy required to break the bond. Bond strength, determined by bond length, atom size, and the number of bonds, reflects the strength of the attraction between atoms.
