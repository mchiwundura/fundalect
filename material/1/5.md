## Geometrical Optics

Geometrical optics uses the concept of light rays to describe the propagation of light.  Light rays are perpendicular to the wavefronts of light.

### Reflection

Light rays reflect off surfaces.  The angle of incidence ($\\theta_i$) is the angle between the incident ray and the normal (a line perpendicular to the surface at the point of incidence). The angle of reflection ($\\theta_r$) is the angle between the reflected ray and the normal.

The **Law of Reflection** states:

* $\\theta_i = \\theta_r$
* The incident ray, reflected ray, and normal all lie in the same plane.

### Refraction

Refraction occurs when light passes from one medium to another. The speed of light changes, but its frequency remains constant.  This change in speed causes the light ray to bend.

The **refractive index** ($n$) of a material is defined as:

$n = \\frac{c}{v}$

where $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum, and $v$ is the speed of light in the material.

**Snell's Law** describes the relationship between the angles of incidence and refraction:

$n_1 \\sin \\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin \\theta_2$

where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the refractive indices of the two media, and $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.

Light traveling from a denser medium to a less dense medium is refracted *away* from the normal.  Light traveling from a less dense medium to a denser medium is refracted *towards* the normal.


### Total Internal Reflection

The **critical angle** is the angle of incidence at which the angle of refraction is 90Â°.  If the angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle (when light travels from a denser to a less dense medium), total internal reflection occurs â€“ all light is reflected back into the denser medium.  This phenomenon is used in optical fibers and endoscopes.
