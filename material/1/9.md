## Electrostatics

### Electrostatic Charge

Objects can be positively charged, negatively charged, or neutral.

### Coulomb's Law

Coulomb's Law describes the electrostatic force between two point charges: The magnitude of the electrostatic force is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

$F = \frac{kQ_1Q_2}{r^2}$

### Electric Field

An electric field is a region of space where an electric charge experiences a force. The direction of the field at a point is the direction a positive test charge would move if placed there.

### Electric Field Lines

Electric field lines represent the electric field. They point away from positive charges (like charges repel) and towards negative charges (unlike charges attract).

### Electric Field Strength

The magnitude of the electric field, E, at a point is defined as the force per unit charge:

$E = \frac{F}{q}$

The units of electric field strength are Newtons per Coulomb (N·C⁻¹).

### Electric Field due to a Point Charge

The electric field due to a point charge Q is:

$E = \frac{F}{q} = \frac{kQ}{r^2}$

### Electrostatic Force

The electrostatic force is attractive for unlike charges and repulsive for like charges.
