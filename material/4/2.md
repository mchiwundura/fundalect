## Arithmetic Sequences

### Definition

An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers where the difference between consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference, denoted by $d$. The $n^{th}$ term of the sequence is denoted as $T_n$.

### Common Difference

The common difference ($d$) is calculated as the difference between any two consecutive terms:

$d = T_n - T_{n-1}$

where $T_n$ is the $n^{th}$ term and $T_{n-1}$ is the term preceding it.


### General Formula

The general formula for finding the $n^{th}$ term ($T_n$) of an arithmetic sequence is:

$T_n = a + (n-1)d$

where:

* $a$ is the first term of the sequence
* $d$ is the common difference
* $n$ is the position of the term in the sequence


This formula allows us to calculate any term in the sequence without needing to calculate all the preceding terms.
