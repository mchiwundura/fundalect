## Trigonometry Basics

### Introduction to Trigonometry

Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with the relationships between the angles and sides of triangles.  In particular, it focuses on right-angled triangles, where one angle is 90 degrees.

### Trigonometric Ratios

Three primary trigonometric ratios are defined for right-angled triangles:

*   **Sine (sin):**  $sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$
*   **Cosine (cos):** $cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$
*   **Tangent (tan):** $tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$

where $\theta$ represents the angle in the right-angled triangle, "opposite" refers to the side opposite the angle, "adjacent" refers to the side next to the angle (not the hypotenuse), and "hypotenuse" is the longest side, opposite the right angle.


### Applications of Trigonometry

Trigonometry has many real-world applications, including:

*   **Surveying:** Determining distances and heights indirectly.
*   **Navigation:** Calculating distances and bearings.
*   **Engineering:** Designing structures and calculating forces.
*   **Physics:** Analyzing projectile motion and wave phenomena.


### Angles of Elevation and Depression

*   **Angle of Elevation:** The angle measured upwards from the horizontal to the line of sight of an object above the horizontal.
*   **Angle of Depression:** The angle measured downwards from the horizontal to the line of sight of an object below the horizontal.

These angles are crucial in solving problems involving height and distance measurements.
