## Linear and Quadratic Equations and Inequalities

### Linear Equations

A linear equation has a variable with an exponent of 1. It has at most one solution.

### Quadratic Equations

A quadratic equation has a variable with an exponent of at most 2. It has at most two solutions.

### Simultaneous Equations

To solve for two unknown variables, two equations (a system of simultaneous equations) are needed.  These can be solved using:

*   **Algebraic methods:** Substitution or elimination.
*   **Graphical methods:**  Finding the point of intersection of the graphs of each equation. The coordinates of this point represent the solution.

### Literal Equations

Literal equations contain multiple letters and variables.

### Word Problems

Word problems require translating the problem into a set of mathematical equations.

### Linear Inequalities

A linear inequality is similar to a linear equation (the exponent of the variable is 1).  However, the solution is a range of values, not a single value.  Remember that when multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the direction of the inequality sign reverses (e.g.,  $x > 5$ becomes $x < -5$ if multiplied by -1).
