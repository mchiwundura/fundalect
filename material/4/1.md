## Laws of Exponents

### Chapter Summary

Exponential notation represents a number in the form $a^n$, where $n$ is any natural number and $a$ is any real number.  $a$ is called the base, and $n$ is the exponent or index.

**Definitions:**

*   $a^n = a \times a \times \cdots \times a$ ($n$ times)
*   $a^0 = 1$, if $a \ne 0$
*   $a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n}$, if $a \ne 0$
*   $\frac{1}{a^{-n}} = a^n$, if $a \ne 0$

**Laws of Exponents:**

*   $a^m \times a^n = a^{m + n}$
*   $\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m - n}$
*   $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$
*   $(\frac{a}{b})^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n}$
*   $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$

**Simplifying Expressions:** When simplifying expressions with exponents, reduce the bases to prime bases or factorize.

**Solving Equations:** When solving equations with exponents, if $a^x = a^y$, then $x = y$; alternatively, factorize the expressions.
