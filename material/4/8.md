The formula is: $A = P(1 + i)^n$, where A = accumulated amount, P = principal amount, i = interest rate (as a decimal), and n = number of years.  Unlike simple interest, the interest earned also earns interest in subsequent periods."

## Simple and Compound Interest

This section summarizes simple and compound interest, along with their applications.

### Interest Rates

There are two main types of interest rates:

*   **Simple Interest:** Interest is calculated only on the principal amount.
*   **Compound Interest:** Interest is calculated on both the principal amount and accumulated interest.

### Formulas

The following formulas are used for calculating simple and compound interest:

*   **Simple Interest:** $A = P(1 + in)$
*   **Compound Interest:** $A = P(1 + i)^n$

Where:

| Variable | Description             |
| :------- | :---------------------- |
| $A$      | Accumulated amount      |
| $P$      | Principal amount         |
| $i$      | Interest rate (decimal) |
| $n$      | Number of years         |


### Applications

*   **Hire Purchase Loan Repayments:**  Simple interest is used to calculate repayments. The interest is calculated on the cash price less any deposit, and monthly repayments are determined by dividing the total accumulated amount by the number of months.

*   **Population Growth and Inflation:** Compound interest is used to model population growth and inflation over time.


### Foreign Exchange Rates

A foreign exchange rate is the value of one currency expressed in terms of another.
