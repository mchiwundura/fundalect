## Probability Fundamentals

### Basic Concepts

* **Experiment:** An uncertain process.
* **Outcome:** A single result of an experiment.
* **Sample Space ($S$):** The set of all possible outcomes.  The size of the sample space is denoted by $n(S)$.
* **Event ($E$):** A specific set of outcomes of interest. The number of outcomes in the event is denoted by $n(E)$.
* **Probability:** A number between 0 and 1 representing the likelihood of an event.  A probability of 0 means the event will never occur, and a probability of 1 means it will always occur.

### Calculating Probability

* **Theoretical Probability:** If all outcomes are equally likely, the probability of event $E$ is given by:  $P(E) = \frac{n(E)}{n(S)}$
* **Relative Frequency:** The number of times an event occurs in experimental trials, divided by the total number of trials:  $f = \frac{p}{n}$ (where $p$ is the number of positive trials and $n$ is the total number of trials).

### Set Operations and Probability

* **Union of Sets ($A \cup B$ or $A \text{ or } B$):** Contains all elements in at least one of sets A or B.
* **Intersection of Sets ($A \cap B$ or $A \text{ and } B$):** Contains all elements in both sets A and B.
* **Probability of the Sample Space:** $P(S) = 1$
* **Probability of the Union of Two Events:** $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$

### Special Events

* **Mutually Exclusive Events:** Two events that cannot occur simultaneously.
* **Complement of a Set ($A'$ or 'not(A)' ):** The set of all elements not in A.
* **Complementary Events:** Mutually exclusive events whose union is the entire sample space. Their probabilities add up to 1: $P(A) + P(A') = 1$.
