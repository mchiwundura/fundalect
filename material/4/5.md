## Function Characteristics and Special Functions

### Characteristics of Functions

*   **Independent and Dependent Variables:** The $x$-value is the independent variable (chosen freely), and the calculated $y$-value is the dependent variable (depends on $x$).
*   **Domain and Range:** The domain is the set of all $x$-values for which there is at most one $y$-value. The range is the set of all possible $y$-values.
*   **Asymptote:** A straight line that a function's graph approaches but never touches.


### Special Functions and Their Properties

The following are examples of common functions and their general forms:

| Function Type       | General Form          |
|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Linear               | $y = ax + q$           |
| Parabolic            | $y = ax^2 + q$         |
| Hyperbolic           | $y = \frac{a}{x} + q$ |
| Exponential          | $y = ab^x + q$         |
| Trigonometric (Sine) | $y = a\sin\theta + q$ |
| Trigonometric (Cosine)| $y = a\cos\theta + q$ |
| Trigonometric (Tangent)| $y = a\tan\theta + q$ |
