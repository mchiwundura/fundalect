## Quadrilaterals and the Mid-Point Theorem

### Quadrilaterals

A quadrilateral is a closed shape consisting of four straight line segments.  Several special types of quadrilaterals exist, each with unique properties:

#### Parallelogram

* Both pairs of opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.
* Both pairs of opposite angles are equal.
* Diagonals bisect each other.

#### Rectangle

* A parallelogram with all four angles equal to $90Â°$.
* Opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.
* Diagonals bisect each other and are equal in length.


#### Rhombus

* A parallelogram with all four sides equal in length.
* Opposite angles are equal.
* Diagonals bisect each other at $90Â°$ and bisect the opposite angles.

#### Square

* A rhombus with all four angles equal to $90Â°$.
* All sides are equal in length.
* Diagonals bisect each other at $90Â°$ and are equal in length.
* Diagonals bisect opposite angles (resulting in $45Â°$ angles).

#### Trapezium

* A quadrilateral with one pair of opposite sides parallel.

#### Kite

* Two pairs of adjacent sides are equal.
* One pair of opposite angles are equal (the angles between unequal sides).
* The diagonal connecting the equal sides bisects the other diagonal and bisects the interior angles.
* The diagonals intersect at $90Â°$.


### Mid-Point Theorem

The line joining the mid-points of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and equal to half the length of the third side.
