## Descriptive Statistics

### Types of Data

* **Data:** Observed and recorded information.
* **Quantitative Data:** Numerical data (discrete or continuous).
* **Qualitative Data:** Non-numerical data (categorical or anecdotal).

### Measures of Central Tendency

* **Mean:** The average value ($\\overline{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{x}_{i}$).
* **Median:** The middle value in an ordered data set.
* **Mode:** The most frequent value.

### Measures of Dispersion

* **Range:** The difference between the maximum and minimum values.
* **Percentile:** The value below which a given percentage of data falls.  The $p^{th}$ percentile is calculated using the formula: $r = \\frac{p}{100}(n - 1) + 1$.
* **Quartiles:** Values that divide the data into four equal parts ($Q_1$, $Q_2$ (median), $Q_3$).
* **Interquartile Range (IQR):** $Q_3 - Q_1$. Represents the spread of the middle 50% of the data.
* **Semi-Interquartile Range:** $\\frac{Q_3 - Q_1}{2}$
* **Five-Number Summary:** Minimum, $Q_1$, Median, $Q_3$, Maximum.
* **Box-and-Whisker Plot:** A graphical representation of the five-number summary.

### Outliers

Values significantly different from the rest of the data set.
