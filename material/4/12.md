## Quadrilaterals and the Mid-point Theorem

### Quadrilaterals

A quadrilateral is a closed shape with four straight line segments.  Several special types of quadrilaterals exist:

#### Parallelogram

*   Both pairs of opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.
*   Both pairs of opposite angles are equal.
*   The diagonals bisect each other.

#### Rectangle

*   A parallelogram with all four angles equal to $90°$.
*   Opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.
*   Diagonals bisect each other and are equal in length.

#### Rhombus

*   A parallelogram with all four sides equal in length.
*   Opposite angles are equal.
*   Diagonals bisect each other at $90°$ and bisect the opposite angles.

#### Square

*   A rhombus with all four angles equal to $90°$.
*   Opposite sides are parallel.
*   Diagonals bisect each other at $90°$ and are equal in length.
*   All interior angles are $45°$.

#### Trapezium

*   A quadrilateral with one pair of opposite sides parallel.

#### Kite

*   Two pairs of adjacent sides are equal in length.
*   One pair of opposite angles are equal (the angles between unequal sides).
*   The diagonal connecting the equal sides bisects the other diagonal and the interior angles.
*   The diagonals intersect at $90°$.


### Mid-point Theorem

The line segment joining the mid-points of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and is half its length.
