## Trigonometric Ratios and Equations

### Trigonometric Ratios

We define three primary trigonometric ratios for right-angled triangles: sine ($\sin$), cosine ($\cos$), and tangent ($\tan$).  These are defined as follows:

* $\sin \theta = \frac{opposite}{hypotenuse} = \frac{y}{r}$
* $\cos \theta = \frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse} = \frac{x}{r}$
* $\tan \theta = \frac{opposite}{adjacent} = \frac{y}{x}$

where  `y` represents the length of the side opposite angle $\theta$, `x` represents the length of the side adjacent to angle $\theta$, and `r` represents the length of the hypotenuse.


### Reciprocal Trigonometric Ratios

Each of the primary trigonometric ratios has a reciprocal:

* $\csc \theta = \frac{1}{\sin \theta} = \frac{hypotenuse}{opposite} = \frac{r}{y}$ (cosecant)
* $\sec \theta = \frac{1}{\cos \theta} = \frac{hypotenuse}{adjacent} = \frac{r}{x}$ (secant)
* $\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta} = \frac{adjacent}{opposite} = \frac{x}{y}$ (cotangent)


### Solving Trigonometric Equations

We can use the trigonometric ratios and principles of solving equations to solve simple trigonometric equations.


### Special Angles

For the angles 0¬∞, 30¬∞, 45¬∞, 60¬∞, and 90¬∞, the values of $\sin$, $\cos$, and $\tan$ can be easily determined without a calculator.


### Extended Definitions

The definitions of trigonometric ratios can be extended to encompass any angle, not just those within right-angled triangles.
