## Area, Volume, and Surface Area of Geometric Solids

### Area

Area measures the two-dimensional space inside a flat object's boundary. It is measured in square units.  Formulas for common shapes include:

* **Square:** $s^2$ ($s$ = side length)
* **Rectangle:** $b \times h$ ($b$ = base, $h$ = height)
* **Triangle:** $\frac{1}{2}b \times h$ ($b$ = base, $h$ = height)
* **Trapezium:** $\frac{1}{2}(a+b) \times h$ ($a$ and $b$ are parallel sides, $h$ = height)
* **Parallelogram:** $b \times h$ ($b$ = base, $h$ = height)
* **Circle:** $\pi r^2$ ($r$ = radius)

### Volume

Volume measures the three-dimensional space occupied by an object. It's measured in cubic units. Formulas for prisms and cylinders:

* **Rectangular Prism:** $l \times b \times h$ ($l$ = length, $b$ = width, $h$ = height)
* **Triangular Prism:** $(\frac{1}{2}b \times h) \times H$ ($b$ and $h$ are base and height of the triangle, $H$ = prism height)
* **Cube:** $s^3$ ($s$ = side length)
* **Cylinder:** $\pi r^2 \times h$ ($r$ = radius, $h$ = height)


Formulas for pyramids, cones, and spheres:

* **Square Pyramid:** $\frac{1}{3} \times b^2 \times H$ ($b$ = base side length, $H$ = height)
* **Triangular Pyramid:** $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2}bh \times H$ ($b$ and $h$ are base and height of the triangle, $H$ = pyramid height)
* **Cone:** $\frac{1}{3} \times \pi r^2 \times H$ ($r$ = radius, $H$ = height)
* **Sphere:** $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ ($r$ = radius)

### Surface Area

Surface area is the total area of a solid's outer surfaces.  Formulas for right pyramids, cones, and spheres:

* **Square Pyramid:** $b(b + 2h)$ ($b$ = base side length, $h$ = slant height)
* **Triangular Pyramid:** $\frac{1}{2}b(h_b + 3h_s)$ ($b$ = base length, $h_b$ = base height, $h_s$ = slant height)
* **Cone:** $\pi r(r + h_s)$ ($r$ = radius, $h_s$ = slant height)
* **Sphere:** $4\pi r^2$ ($r$ = radius)

### Prisms and Cylinders

A right prism has a polygon base, vertical sides perpendicular to the base, and identical top and bottom surfaces.  A cylinder is a right prism with a circular base.  Multiplying a prism or cylinder's dimensions by a constant $k$ multiplies the surface area by $k^2$ and the volume by $k^3$.

### Pyramids and Cones

A pyramid has a polygon base and sides converging at an apex. A cone is similar to a pyramid but has a circular base.  A right pyramid/cone has an apex directly above the base's center.
