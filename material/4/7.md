## Analytical Geometry

### Points and Distance

A point in a coordinate system is represented by an ordered pair of numbers $(x, y)$.  The distance ($d$) between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is calculated using the distance formula:

$$d = \sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}$$

### Gradient and Straight Lines

The gradient ($m$) of a line represents its steepness and is calculated as:

$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

A straight line has a constant gradient between any two of its points. The equation of a straight line can be written in the standard form:

$y = mx + c$

where $m$ is the gradient and $c$ is the $y$-intercept.  Alternatively, using two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, the equation can be written as:

$$ \frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} $$

### Parallel and Perpendicular Lines

Parallel lines have equal gradients.  Perpendicular lines have gradients whose product is -1.  Horizontal lines have a gradient of 0, and vertical lines have an undefined gradient.


### Midpoint

The midpoint $M(x, y)$ between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by:

$$M(x, y) = \left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)$$
