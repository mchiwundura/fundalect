## Five Number Summary and Box-and-Whisker Plots

The five-number summary is a concise way to describe a dataset using five key values: the minimum, first quartile ($Q_1$), median ($Q_2$), third quartile ($Q_3$), and maximum.  These values represent the 0th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 100th percentiles, respectively.

A box-and-whisker plot visually displays this five-number summary. The box represents the interquartile range (IQR), the distance between $Q_1$ and $Q_3$.  A line inside the box marks the median. Whiskers extend from the box to the minimum and maximum values.


### Calculating the Five-Number Summary

1. **Sort the data:** Arrange the data points in ascending order.

2. **Find the minimum and maximum:** The smallest and largest values are the minimum and maximum, respectively.

3. **Find the median:**
   - For an odd number of data points, the median is the middle value.
   - For an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle values.

4. **Find the quartiles:**
   - $Q_1$ (first quartile): The median of the lower half of the data (values below the median).
   - $Q_3$ (third quartile): The median of the upper half of the data (values above the median).


### Worked Example

Let's consider the dataset: {1.25, 1.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.25, 4.75, 4.8, 4.95, 5.1}

1. **Minimum:** 1.25
2. **Maximum:** 5.1
3. **Median:** $\frac{3.2 + 4.1}{2} = 3.65$
4. **$Q_1$:** $\frac{2.5 + 2.5}{2} = 2.5$
5. **$Q_3$:** $\frac{4.75 + 4.8}{2} = 4.775$

The five-number summary is: Minimum = 1.25, $Q_1$ = 2.5, Median = 3.65, $Q_3$ = 4.775, Maximum = 5.1.  This data can then be used to construct a box-and-whisker plot.  Additional examples with different datasets can be worked through similarly.
